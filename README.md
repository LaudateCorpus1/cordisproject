# Description

A global mod is under development, it includes numerous improvements and additions. Among them: graphics (interface, rendering, visual effects), sound (new sounds from high-quality libraries or recorded from scratch), the musical component of the game (ambient music and dynamic music, created individually for the project). 

In addition, the models of the environment / inventory items / stalkers / mutants will be replaced, and both animations are added, simply replacing some old ones, and completely new ones. As for the locations, it was decided not to touch the original territories of "Call of Pripyat", but to create one or several completely new ones, which will demonstrate all possible innovations.
